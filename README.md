# Eye-Nose-Mouse
My Bachelor's FYP
This is computer vision based project I have done as my Bachelor's Final Year Project. The idea was to
control cursor movement, mouse clicks, and keyboard typing with your eyes and nose tip movements through
webcam. Developed face recognition based module which detects eyes and nose in facial features using
OpenCV, then mapped the nose tip movement to cursor movement, left/right eye wink to left/right mouse
click and right eye twice wink as double click. Also, developed an on-screen keyboard for typing through eye
winks.
